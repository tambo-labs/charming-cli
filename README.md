# Charming CLI

Build and manage personal apps hosted by [Charming](https://charm.ing) from a terminal or coding agent.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g usecharming
# or
brew install tambo-labs/tap/charming
```

To install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tambo-labs/charming-cli.git
cd charming-cli
bun install
bun run build
bun link
charming doctor
```

Remove the link with `bun unlink`.

## First app

```bash
charming auth login --no-open
charming apps create examples/hello --dry-run
charming apps create examples/hello --yes
```

Commands write JSON results to stdout. Login instructions and JSON errors go to stderr. Run mutations with `--dry-run` first. Live deletions and signed-in creates require `--yes`.

Command help and input validation come from [oclif](https://oclif.io). Run `charming <topic> <command> --help` to see the generated usage and flags for any command, or `charming --help` for the full command list.

## Environment

- `CHARMING_TOKEN`: user-token override.
- `CHARMING_BASE_URL`: API origin override.
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`: config-directory override.

The CLI stores credentials in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/charming/config.json`, or `~/.config/charming/config.json`, with user-only permissions.

## Development

The source of truth is [`packages/cli` in the Charming monorepo](https://github.com/tambo-ai/charming/tree/main/packages/cli). This public repository is a generated mirror. Source pull requests opened here cannot be merged because the next mirror run replaces the full tree.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tambo-ai/charming.git
cd charming
bun install
bun run cli:gen
bun run --filter usecharming check
```

`openapi.json` is synced from the monorepo's committed OpenAPI contract. `src/generated/operations.ts` is generated from it with the pinned Hey API version. Do not edit either generated file in the public mirror. `UPSTREAM.json` records the source URL and contract digest.
